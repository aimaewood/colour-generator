# colour-generator
## Fetching data from an API to generate random colour codes.

For this project, I practised:

- fetching data from an API
- handling error responses from the API
- throwing my own warning messages in the console and to the user in the HTML
- writing JS functions
- using event handlers
- adding elements to the HTML
- centring and styling elements with CSS

I enjoyed pseudo-coding my route to a solution before writing the Javascript. The more I practise this skill, the more challenging problems I feel able to solve. 

Getting to grips with fetch requests for the first time was tough but fun; I'm starting to appreciate how powerful the use of APIs can be and I'm looking forward to working more with them.

I found the error handling a bit tricky at first but, after reading more about the syntax, types of error (e.g. 200 and 404) and various use cases, I arrived at a clean solution that throws consistent errors both in the console and to the user whenever the randomly generated fetch URL does not exist.
